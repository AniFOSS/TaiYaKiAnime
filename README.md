## FAQ

_Is Taiyaki legal?_

#### Yes! Taiyaki does not host any of these anime on any server, neither is it maintained. Instead Taiyaki scrapes the data of various websites, stripping the unnecessary (and sometimes harmful) ads out of the way

---

_Will Taiyaki be available for my Android TV or Desktop?_

#### As Taiyaki improves more devices will be supported. But the most certain answer would be most likely. This would be a quicker process as most of the logic is done, the layout however would have to be updated to be reflected based on the desired screen size

---

_Can I request a source?_

#### Of course! Join the Discord server and ask around to see if anyone is willing to fulfill your request. You can contribute by learning how to make one and then making it available for the rest of the community

---

_How do I report a bug?_

#### No app is perfect. If you find any bugs or something that doesn't look right, you can report this in the Discord where it would most definitely be seen. Most of the users on there should be able to help you out for any other issues that you may be having

---

_How do I contribute to Taiyaki?_

#### The source code for Taiyaki is available on Github. You can help out by forking the project, modifying, adding, or fixing up bugs, then make a pull request, and wait for it to be reviewed and merged!
