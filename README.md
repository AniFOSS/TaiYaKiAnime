# Yes this is the final commit

# No the project is not dead

Taiyaki was the first project I ever did using Typescript / Javascript, while i was learning Typescript along with React Native I pushed updates, without caring about cleanliness. (I had no idea it would actually become a solid hobby)

#### Now that with more experience, looking at the code I see that it's a mess. Unecessary code, 20 yards of trailing whitespaces, uneccessary packages, functions placed in the wrong files, etc....

This release is the final commit and will be archived for the moment. Another repository will be made, but will be open sourced from the beginning. This will be somewhat the same(just in case i decide to change a bit of the UI), but much more cleaner. Anyone reading this is welcome to contribute. After this project is done, it will be merged to this repository and will unarchive.
