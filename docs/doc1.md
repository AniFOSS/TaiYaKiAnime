#### Syncing up with three different sources(and more to come) you'll get much more than what you were expecting. Whether it's the name, background info, stats, or even character info Taiyaki has got you covered

Taiyaki is intended for users to watch anime without intrusive and even malicious ads from interrupting. It is however not intended to promote piracy, but can be seen as a way to obtain it the same way with the exception of keeping the users safe.
