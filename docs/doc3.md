title: Sources
---

Sources on Taiyaki are not hosted neither are they contained on any server. Instead Taiyaki scrapes these sources from various websites.

Before Taiyaki would keep these sources within the app, but over time these third party websites would change their HTML, rendering the sources broken. Now these sources are hosted on [Github](https://github.com/Michael24884/taiyaki-repos) in a separate repo

Sources use the JavaScript language with the help of Cheerio(a web parser) to scrape contents off websites. For more complicated documents, Taiyaki uses an in-app webview in order to either bypass Cloudflare verification or much more complicated tasks
